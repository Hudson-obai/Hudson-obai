### Hi there 👋


👋 Hi, I’m Hudson Oino Obai, a backend software developer in Bayern, Germany with 2 years experience.

👀 I enjoy working on robust, secure and scalable backend systems for small-scale enterprises and large companies. My language of choice is Java and the go to framework is Springboot.

🌱 I’m currently learning Android, Developer Operations and Team Collaborating tools.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open source Android and Spring web projects.

📫 You can reach me on my primary email Hudsonobai@gmail.com. Check out my portfolio at www.hudsonobai.com.
